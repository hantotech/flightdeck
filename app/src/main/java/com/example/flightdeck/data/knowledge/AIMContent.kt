                    Go-Around Procedure (VFR):
                    1. Apply full power
                    2. Carb heat OFF (if applicable)
                    3. Flaps to takeoff setting (gradual)
                    4. Pitch for Vy (best rate of climb)
                    5. Positive rate of climb - retract remaining flaps
                    6. Follow ATC instructions

                    CRITICAL: Never hesitate to go around if landing doesn't look right.
                    It's always better to go around than force a bad landing.

                    1. "MAYDAY, MAYDAY, MAYDAY"
                    2. Callsign (three times if time permits)

                    5. Position, altitude, heading
                    6. Souls on board, fuel remaining (time)

                    Transponder: Squawk 7700 for emergency

                    Radio Frequency:
                    - Stay on current frequency if in contact with ATC
                    - If no contact, try 121.5 MHz (emergency frequency)

                    PIC Authority:

                    - Immediate danger to aircraft or persons
                    - Examples: Engine failure, fire, structural failure

                    Urgency (PAN-PAN):
                    - Concern for safety but not immediate danger
                    - Examples: Low fuel, weather diversion, passenger medical issue

                    Emergency Frequencies:
                    - 121.5 MHz - Civil emergency (VHF)
                    - 243.0 MHz - Military emergency (UHF)
                    - Monitored by ATC, FSS, and military facilities

                    After Initial MAYDAY/PAN-PAN:

                    - Watch for light gun signals at towered airport

                    Unlawful Interference (Hijacking):
                    - Squawk 7500
                    - Follow hijacker instructions for safety
